# GA WDI-34 Project 1 - Mouse Maze Game

For my first project my inspiration came from a modern mouse maze game I played on the apple store and also my two cats who love catching mice. Completing this project allowed me to use the my skills learnt in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JQuery libary).  

Mouse Maze was idea was taken from multiple maze games but also my imagination.

##### Game development
The mouse maze game was developed is a grid-based environment which allowed me to develop a map and include a player mouse, enemies which are the cats and cheese as the treats. The player and enemies are able to walkthrough the maze and come through the opposite end. I built a one player game allowing the mouse to be moved by the player using the keyboard up, down, left and right keys. The three cat enemies are controlled by the computer generating a random direction of travel.

All cheese items have been picked up to allow the player to win the game. I have built a function which when you encounter a cat the game ends, takes you to a end game page for you to reset and start again.

##### Planned features
The game is relatively simple and my desire would be to add additional features to enhance the gaming experience.

A variety of levels which gradually makes the user interaction harder which includes obstacles and potions. Finally I would also like to include a scoreboard and life tracker to make the game be personal to the player.

I enjoyed producing this game and am happy with the final product as it works as a basic game. I am looking to implement the planned features but also looking forward to making other games to test my abilities.
